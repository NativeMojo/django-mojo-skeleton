"""Sync a Let's Encrypt lineage between load-balanced nodes via S3.

ONE node renews, every other node follows. Which one renews is decided by
hostname, so the same image can be booted N times and userdata's hostname
assignment picks the renewer — nothing else differs between nodes.

    primary  (hostname == PRIMARY_BALANCER_HOST)  certbot runs here -> uploads
    replica  (anything else)                      downloads when S3 is newer

Install (every node, from cron, as root — /etc/letsencrypt is root-only):

    * * * * * root /opt/api/aws/certbot_sync.py >> /opt/api/var/logs/certbot_sync.log 2>&1

Safe to install unconditionally: with AWS_CERT_BUCKET or LOAD_BALANCER_DOMAIN
absent from var/django.conf the script logs one line and exits 0, so a
single-node box runs it forever as a no-op.

Config, read straight out of /opt/api/var/django.conf (no Django import — this
has to work on a box whose app is broken, and it must be fast enough to run
every minute):

    AWS_REGION              required
    AWS_CERT_BUCKET         required  — bucket holding the shared lineage
    LOAD_BALANCER_DOMAIN    required  — the certbot lineage name
    PRIMARY_BALANCER_HOST   required  — hostname of the renewing node
    AWS_KEY / AWS_SECRET    OPTIONAL  — omit to use the instance role

    Prefer the instance role when the project's storage backend can use one.
    Static keys in a config file are material that leaks with any file-read
    bug or stray backup; a role scoped to this one bucket prefix is strictly
    less to lose.

WHY THIS SYNCS THE PRIVATE KEY, when older copies of this script only synced
fullchain.pem: nginx needs `ssl_certificate` AND `ssl_certificate_key`, and they
must be a matching pair. A node that pulls a fresh fullchain while holding its
own or a stale privkey fails every TLS handshake on the next reload. A
fullchain-only sync appears to work right up until the first renewal after a
second node exists, and then takes that node's TLS down.

  * All three files move together (fullchain, privkey, chain — chain is what
    `ssl_trusted_certificate` wants for OCSP stapling).
  * The downloaded key is checked against the downloaded cert BEFORE either is
    installed, by comparing public keys. A mismatched pair is discarded and the
    node keeps serving what it has.
  * Install is os.replace() per file — atomic per file — and privkey lands 0600.
  * nginx is config-tested before reload, so a bad state aborts instead of
    taking the node's TLS down.

THIS IS A PULL, so it belongs only between mutually-trusted nodes of the same
tier. Do not use it to move certificates to a box in a different trust zone (a
public content host, a tenant-operated node): a pull means that box holds a
credential that reads the shared lineage. Push from the trusted side instead, so
compromising the exposed box does not hand anyone a route back.

Typical topology this is written for — an NLB doing TCP passthrough, with the
ACME listener pointed at exactly one node:

    NLB :80  (TCP) -> target group containing ONLY the primary   <- challenges
    NLB :443 (TCP) -> target group containing every node          <- traffic

Because :80 reaches only the primary, every HTTP-01 challenge lands on the node
running certbot; this script then distributes the result. Keep the target-group
membership and PRIMARY_BALANCER_HOST naming the same node — if they drift, the
node receiving challenges will think it is a replica and never publish, and
renewals stop silently.

Longer term this whole file should give way to dnsman's Certificate model
(KMS-encrypted material in the shared DB, renew_certificates() on a schedule) —
no bucket, no direction, no second credential story.
